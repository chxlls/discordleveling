# Leveling System
### Using Quick.db & Discord.js

##### This is from a Discord bot I am creating for a Garrys Mod Community (Check below for links to the community) and we decided to remove the leveling so I am putting it up on here amongst my other JS creations. The code is a bit messy as I never got around to cleaning it up.
##### A star is always appreciated. I am not updating this anymore, I will happily review pull requests though.
